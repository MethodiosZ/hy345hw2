In my implementation I use static arrays to keep track of students on stops/bus/university. 
Default N is 4 and T is 10. 
Prints are a little of because I didnt want to overdo it with using mutex locks (but they would probably set the output straight).
It also does an extra empty trip sometimes just because how the bus thread loop works
